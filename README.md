### **DetectiFi: AI-Powered Crime Scene Investigation**

SceneSolver is an AI-driven tool designed to assist law enforcement in analyzing crime scenes more efficiently and accurately. Traditional forensic investigations are time-consuming and prone to human oversight, but SceneSolver leverages AI to speed up and improve the process.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Crime Classification**  
   - Uses an AI model called CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) to analyze crime scene images.  
   - Automatically categorizes crimes (e.g., robbery, burglary) by understanding objects, actions, and relationships in images.

2. **Evidence Extraction**  
   - Employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to detect critical details in crime scene images.  
   - Can identify small yet crucial evidence (e.g., shards of glass in a hit-and-run case) that humans might miss.

#### **How it Works:**
- Investigators upload images via a user-friendly dashboard.  
- AI processes large amounts of evidence quickly and securely.  
- Generates instant crime summaries with key evidence and potential leads.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Faster Investigations** – Reduces case-solving time significantly.  
- **Increased Accuracy** – Trained on real crime data (UCF Crime Dataset) for reliability.  
- **Enhanced Decision-Making** – Provides investigators with organized crime summaries.  

#### **Other Potential Uses:**
- Emergency response (e.g., identifying survivors in disaster zones).  
- Crime prevention through pattern analysis.  
- Applications in healthcare, traffic monitoring, and financial fraud detection.  

### **Summary:**  
SceneSolver is a groundbreaking AI tool that enhances crime scene investigations while ensuring human oversight. However, ethical considerations are essential to prevent misuse. The technology could revolutionize multiple fields beyond law enforcement.
